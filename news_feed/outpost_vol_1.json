	"body": "<p>We've all heard the stories. Spectral hands writing in blood, lights flickering, discordant screams. Outpost-21 has had a long history of so-called hauntings, ever since it was originally colonized. After the crash of '93 where a D-Class 'Star-Schooner' crashed into the second moon, resulting in all 7,413 souls being lost, paranormal activity on the planet increased drastically. Demons clawing at backs, screams with no bodies shattering windows, even the terraformer having nightmares requiring it to be hushed back to sleep with frequent lullabies. All of this hostile paranormal activity resulting in the second moon being destroyed, giving us the belt we have today.</p><br><p>But how real are these paranormal events? Even today, we have ghosts writing in blood, cameras taking pictures of transparent people not truly there, lights flickering, and screams causing nosebleeds. But I assure you, none of these are paranomal, or even strange!</p><br><p>The ghostly writing can easily be attributed to shadekin. Faded pictures are poor quality cameras. Lights flickering is a well-known side effect of shadekin phasing, and the frequent brownouts and blackouts the station faces due to insufficient engineering. Even the 'paranomal clowns', the circumorphs that stalk maintenance could be chalked up to a scientific experiment gone wrong. We all know xenobiology goes too far! Why attribute it to the supernatural when we know it is not?</p><br><p>So please, my fellow stationers, we must stop spreading such false rumors of supernatural things. The moon was blown up for the security a belt provides, clowns are from clownplanet not hell, and research digs up horrifying artifacts from the depths they should keep buried.</p><br><p>Redspace is very real, though.</p>",

	"title": "Authorization of Preemptive Security On Frontier Stations. Feb 2, 2568",
	"body": "<p>In recent weeks, Solgov has lessened its restrictions on regulation 141702 'Usage of Stationary and Mobile Traps and Security Deterrence' to allow for usage of such devices on frontier stations accosted by 'frequent, significant, and persistent threats on stations with insufficient security.'</p><br><p>Due to the recent rise in paranormal circumorph infestations, Chu'ukara infestations, stowaways, and suspected syndicate infiltration; local station Outpost-21 has recently been approved for exception to this regulation, which it had previously only had clearance for such measures around the armory.</p><br><p>While opponents of the relaxation of the regulation, such as Nanotrasen officials, argue the decision is ineffective with headlines such as 'SolGov allows for landmines to be used in bathrooms.' E-Shui law makes clear that crew members may not place destructive measures in commonly traveled areas, or anywhere where any destructive nature of a trap would damage critical station functions. As such, 'booby traps' are not authorized to be placed in any crew living areas of the station except during a red-level threat, and any explosive or other destruction-oriented traps are not to be placed in areas of critical infrastructure.</p><br><p>E-Shui officials at Outpost-21's Central Command hopes the new measures will allow crew members to 'have comfort in knowing they can take measures to protect their own station in the sector-wide security staffing crisis. And take active measures against reoccurring station threats. We trust this change in SolGov law will allow the maintenance tunnels and caverns of Outpost-21 to no longer be the spider-nest they currently are. Our brave station crew are the frontlines of defending the critical work we do here, and should feel safe in being able to decide their own defenses.'</p>",

	"title": "Approval of New Science Wing. Feb 14, 2568",
	"body": "<p>Recently, E-Shui officials have approved construction for a Phoronics wing at local Outpost-21. The wing had previously not been on the original construction plans of the facility due to many 'not seeing a point' to the explosively-oriented department. Saying 'Phoronics is a lab all about creating explosives. We have the BSA, complete security armory, and mining is off-world. There is no need for high explosive creation, typically used in conjunction with mining. Further, the risk of such high explosives is an unacceptable risk to the Terraformer.'</p><br><p>However, it appears in recent events, with relaxing SolGov regulations leading to more explosives being required for station security, a much more accurate scope of station threats and a re-review of lackluster mining output, E-Shui officials have given the go-ahead to construct the new wing.</p><br><p>The new wing has been located to be in the Outpost-21 skyline, built into the mountainside North of the current research wing, with an explosive firing range estimated to impact in an area between the Civilian and Engineering buildings, using relocated rock from the mining to better insulate any collateral blasts.</p><br><p>The current design of the new wing is still under consideration by AI units, engineers, research teams, and E-Shui officials; but is expected to undergo final construction in the coming weeks.</p>",
